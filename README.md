### Introduction
The increasing adoption of autonomous systems highlights the need for drift-resilient state estimation. Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) provide continuous position and velocity estimates, but their accuracy deteriorates over time due to sensor biases and noise. While GPS can correct this drift, its limited availability in many environments necessitates alternative update sources, known as "anchors of certainty." Among these, Zero-Velocity Update (ZUPT) is highly effective during stationary intervals. 

However, traditional ZUPTs rely on nonholonomic constraints, restricting their use to surface-bound platforms and making them unsuitable for aerial vehicles, where precise **hovering** is often essential.

This work presents a novel controlled extension, C-ZUPT, supported by LQG control, specifically designed for aerial platforms. By defining an acceptable uncertainty tolerance, C-ZUPT identifies quasi-static equilibria to provide precise velocity updates to the estimation filter. Extensive validation demonstrates that these opportunistic, high-quality updates significantly reduce INS drift and control effort. As a result, C-ZUPT minimizes filter divergence and enhances platform stability, leading to reduced energy consumption and longer hover durations—key benefits for resource-constrained aerial systems.

### Simulation Results

To begin, we demonstrate the functionality of the LQG framework tailored to quadrotor dynamics, focusing on its ability to correct deviations caused by non-equilibrium initial conditions ($\boldsymbol{x}_0 \neq \boldsymbol{x}_e$) and process noise simulating wind. In this baseline scenario, the position update frequency is set equal to the prediction rate ($\Gamma = 1$), as shown in the state trajectories below, observed over a ten-second interval:

To understand the stabilization mechanism coordinating all four control inputs, the left side of the figure shows the LQR input commands as solid lines, with dashed brown lines representing the actual outputs, demonstrating minimal phase lag. The desired setpoint, corresponding to the hovering equilibrium, is marked by a black dashed line, with steady-state reference values for thrust (top) and roll, pitch, and yaw torques. On the right, rotor speeds commanded by the low-level speed controller are calculated by inverting the control outputs via the mixer matrix. Steady-state hover RPM is indicated by black dashed lines, with positive values denoting counter-clockwise rotation.

Lastly, to assess the contribution of the proposed C-ZUPT mechanism, the figure below presents a head-to-head comparison with previous methods, using the same error analysis framework as in earlier evaluations.

As shown, with infrequent updates, the accuracy of estimation rapidly degrades due to inertial sensor noise and the platform's inherently erratic dynamics. This is particularly evident in the unaided case (blue), where errors grow unchecked, requiring aggressive control actions. In contrast, the C-ZUPT cases (pale green) consistently maintain smaller error magnitudes by leveraging detected stationary periods to provide informative corrections.
